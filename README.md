# FizzBuzz in C#
Example on making the CPU play FizzBuzz with up until a number chosen by the user.
Uses a simple while loop with an relational operator to constantly check when to stop.
Has an if-else condition on the loop to check if the number is divisible by 3, 5, or both and returns "Fizz", "Buzz", or "FizzBuzz" based on the results.
If the number is not divisible by 3 or 5, it will return the number itself.
